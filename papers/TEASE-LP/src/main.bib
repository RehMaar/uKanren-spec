abstract="Recently well-quasi orders in general, and homeomorphic embedding in particular, have gained popularity to ensure the termination of program analysis, specialisation and transformation techniques. In this paper we investigate and clarify for the first time, both intuitively and formally, the advantages of such an approach over one using well-founded orders. Notably we show that the homeomorphic embedding relation is strictly more powerful than a large class of involved well-founded approaches.",
